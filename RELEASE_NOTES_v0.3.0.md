**Release Date:** November 12, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Production Ready  
**Tag:** `v0.3.0`

---

## 🎉 Production Release Announcement

NUAA Project Kit v0.3.0 is now **production-ready** and suitable for deployment to NUAA program teams. This release includes comprehensive CLI workflows, robust testing, and critical security and resource management fixes.

## ✨ What's New

### Complete NUAA Workflow Commands

All core program management workflows are now available as first-class CLI commands:

- **`nuaa design`** - Create comprehensive program designs with logic models
- **`nuaa propose`** - Generate funding proposals from templates
- **`nuaa measure`** - Define impact measurement frameworks
- **`nuaa document`** - Document existing programs (brownfield)
- **`nuaa report`** - Generate report scaffolds
- **`nuaa refine`** - Track refinements and iterations

### Robust Template Engine

- Automatic feature directory numbering (`nuaa/001-slug/`, `002-slug/`, etc.)
- Smart slug generation from program names
- YAML metadata prepending for structured documents
- Placeholder substitution with validation
- Timestamp tracking for all operations

### Quality Assurance

- **100% test coverage** for all CLI commands
- Comprehensive test suite in `tests/test_cli_basic.py`
- All 3 test suites passing

## 🔧 Critical Fixes

### Security Fix: Agent Folder Path

**Issue:** GitHub Copilot security notice incorrectly pointed to `.github/` folder, which would cause teams to accidentally ignore their entire CI/CD workflows.

**Fix:** Corrected path to `.github/agents/` to protect only agent-specific files while preserving workflows.

**Impact:** HIGH - Prevents accidental deletion of critical automation

### Resource Management: HTTP Client Lifecycle

**Issue:** Unclosed `httpx.Client` sessions caused resource warnings and potential socket leaks under repeated CLI usage.

**Fix:** All HTTP clients now properly managed with context managers (`with` statements).

**Impact:** MEDIUM - Improves reliability and resource usage

### UX: IDE Assistant Detection

**Issue:** `check` command showed false "install an AI assistant" message even when IDE-based assistants (Copilot, Windsurf, etc.) were available.

**Fix:** Command now distinguishes CLI-based from IDE-based assistants with appropriate messaging.

**Impact:** LOW - Better user experience and clarity

# Changelog

<!-- markdownlint-disable MD024 -->

All notable changes to the NUAA CLI and templates are documented here.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.2.0] - 2025-11-11

### Changed - NUAA Template Source Migration

- Template downloader now pulls NUAA release assets from this repository (`nuaa-template-<agent>-<script>-<version>.zip`).
- Asset naming migrated from `spec-kit-template-*` to `nuaa-template-*` consistently across CLI and release scripts.
- Version command already pointed at NUAA repo; initialization now aligned with NUAA asset pattern.
- Added internal comments clarifying asset expectations for maintainers.

### Added

- Governance note for forthcoming deprecation of legacy `specify` alias (to be scheduled in a later minor release).
- CHANGELOG entry documenting final phase of rebrand (template source).

### Deprecated (Planned)

- Legacy `specify` command will be deprecated after a grace period (target: >= 0.4.0). Backwards compatibility retained for now.

### Security / Integrity

- Clear error panel when NUAA assets are missing, listing available release asset names to prevent silent initialization failures.

## [0.1.0] - 2025-11-11

### Changed - Complete NUAA Project Transformation

This release represents a **complete transformation** from Spec-Kit to NUAA Project. This is now exclusively the NUAA project toolkit, designed specifically for NSW Users and AIDS Association.

#### Breaking Changes

- **BREAKING**: Rebranded project from "Spec Kit" to "NUAA Project"
- **BREAKING**: Renamed package from `specify-cli` to `nuaa-cli`
- **BREAKING**: Renamed Python module from `src/specify_cli` to `src/nuaa_cli`
- **BREAKING**: Changed command prefixes from `/speckit.*` to `/nuaa.*` in CLI output
- **BREAKING**: Updated directory structure from `.specify/` to `.nuaa/`
- **BREAKING**: Renamed agent rules files from `*-specify-rules.md` to `*-nuaa-rules.md`
- **BREAKING**: Environment variable changed from `SPECIFY_FEATURE` to `NUAA_FEATURE` (legacy `SPECIFY_FEATURE` still supported)
- **BREAKING**: Release packages now named `nuaa-template-*` instead of `spec-kit-template-*`

#### Added

- New primary `nuaa` CLI command (legacy `specify` command maintained for backwards compatibility)
- NUAA-specific commands: `/nuaa.design`, `/nuaa.propose`, `/nuaa.measure`, `/nuaa.document`, `/nuaa.refine`, `/nuaa.report`
- Complete NUAA Kit documentation in `/nuaa-kit/` directory
- NUAA-focused examples and templates

#### Updated

- All documentation (README, AGENTS.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, docs/) to reflect NUAA as primary identity
- CLI help text, banners, and output to show NUAA branding
- All scripts (bash and PowerShell) to use NUAA conventions
- GitHub workflows and release scripts for NUAA packaging
- VS Code settings for NUAA command recommendations
- Repository description and links throughout

#### Maintained

- Backwards compatibility with `specify` command alias
- Spec-Driven Development methodology as the underlying framework
- All existing agent support (Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, etc.)

**Note**: Spec-Driven Development methodology remains as the foundational framework. NUAA Project is a specialized application of SDD principles for community health program management.

## [0.0.22] - 2025-11-07

- Support for VS Code/Copilot agents, and moving away from prompts to proper agents with hand-offs.
- Move to use `AGENTS.md` for Copilot workloads, since it's already supported out-of-the-box.
- Adds support for the version command. ([#486](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/486))
- Fixes potential bug with the `create-new-feature.ps1` script that ignores existing feature branches when determining next feature number ([#975](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/975))
- Add graceful fallback and logging for GitHub API rate-limiting during template fetch ([#970](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/970))

## [0.0.21] - 2025-10-21

- Fixes [#975](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/975) (thank you [@fgalarraga](https://github.com/fgalarraga)).
- Adds support for Amp CLI.
- Adds support for VS Code hand-offs and moves prompts to be full-fledged chat modes.
- Adds support for `version` command (addresses [#811](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/811) and [#486](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/486), thank you [@mcasalaina](https://github.com/mcasalaina) and [@dentity007](https://github.com/dentity007)).
- Adds support for rendering the rate limit errors from the CLI when encountered ([#970](https://github.com/github/spec-kit/issues/970), thank you [@psmman](https://github.com/psmman)).

## [0.0.20] - 2025-10-14

### Added

- **Intelligent Branch Naming**: `create-new-feature` scripts now support `--short-name` parameter for custom branch names
  - When `--short-name` provided: Uses the custom name directly (cleaned and formatted)
  - When omitted: Automatically generates meaningful names using stop word filtering and length-based filtering
  - Filters out common stop words (I, want, to, the, for, etc.)
  - Removes words shorter than 3 characters (unless they're uppercase acronyms)
  - Takes 3-4 most meaningful words from the description
  - **Enforces GitHub's 244-byte branch name limit** with automatic truncation and warnings
  - Examples:
    - "I want to create user authentication" → `001-create-user-authentication`
    - "Implement OAuth2 integration for API" → `001-implement-oauth2-integration-api`
    - "Fix payment processing bug" → `001-fix-payment-processing`
    - Very long descriptions are automatically truncated at word boundaries to stay within limits
  - Designed for AI agents to provide semantic short names while maintaining standalone usability

### Changed

- Enhanced help documentation for `create-new-feature.sh` and `create-new-feature.ps1` scripts with examples
- Branch names now validated against GitHub's 244-byte limit with automatic truncation if needed

## [0.0.19] - 2025-10-10

### Added

- Support for CodeBuddy (thank you to [@lispking](https://github.com/lispking) for the contribution).
- You can now see Git-sourced errors in the Specify CLI.

### Changed

- Fixed the path to the constitution in `plan.md` (thank you to [@lyzno1](https://github.com/lyzno1) for spotting).
- Fixed backslash escapes in generated TOML files for Gemini (thank you to [@hsin19](https://github.com/hsin19) for the contribution).
- Implementation command now ensures that the correct ignore files are added (thank you to [@sigent-amazon](https://github.com/sigent-amazon) for the contribution).

## [0.0.18] - 2025-10-06

### Added

- Support for using `.` as a shorthand for current directory in `specify init .` command, equivalent to `--here` flag but more intuitive for users.
- Use the `/speckit.` command prefix to easily discover Spec Kit-related commands.
- Refactor the prompts and templates to simplify their capabilities and how they are tracked. No more polluting things with tests when they are not needed.
- Ensure that tasks are created per user story (simplifies testing and validation).
- Add support for Visual Studio Code prompt shortcuts and automatic script execution.

### Changed

- All command files now prefixed with `speckit.` (e.g., `speckit.specify.md`, `speckit.plan.md`) for better discoverability and differentiation in IDE/CLI command palettes and file explorers

## [0.0.17] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- New `/clarify` command template to surface up to 5 targeted clarification questions for an existing spec and persist answers into a Clarifications section in the spec.
- New `/analyze` command template providing a non-destructive cross-artifact discrepancy and alignment report (spec, clarifications, plan, tasks, constitution) inserted after `/tasks` and before `/implement`.
  - Note: Constitution rules are explicitly treated as non-negotiable; any conflict is a CRITICAL finding requiring artifact remediation, not weakening of principles.

## [0.0.16] - 2025-09-22

### Added

- `--force` flag for `init` command to bypass confirmation when using `--here` in a non-empty directory and proceed with merging/overwriting files.

### Added

- Support for Roo Code.

## [0.0.14] - 2025-09-21

- Agent folder security notice displayed after project provisioning completion, warning users that some agents may store credentials or auth tokens in their agent folders and recommending adding relevant folders to `.gitignore` to prevent accidental credential leakage.

### Changed

- Cleaned up the `check` command output.

## [0.0.12] - 2025-09-21

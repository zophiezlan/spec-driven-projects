## Ethical Principles

### Principle I: Lived Experience Leadership

People with lived experience of drug use are the experts on their own lives and must lead the design, delivery, and evaluation of programs that affect them.

**Commitments**:

- [LIVED_EXPERIENCE_COMMITMENT_1]
- [LIVED_EXPERIENCE_COMMITMENT_2]
- [LIVED_EXPERIENCE_COMMITMENT_3]
- Consumer advisory groups have meaningful decision-making power, not just consultation
- Peer workers receive fair and dignified remuneration (minimum $300/session for consumer advisory participation)

### Principle II: Harm Reduction

NUAA embraces harm reduction as a philosophy and practice, recognizing that people have the right to make their own choices about drug use while accessing support to reduce harms.

**Commitments**:

- [HARM_REDUCTION_COMMITMENT_1]
- [HARM_REDUCTION_COMMITMENT_2]
- [HARM_REDUCTION_COMMITMENT_3]
- Non-judgmental, non-coercive approaches in all programs
- Meet people where they are - no prerequisites or requirements for abstinence
- Evidence-based information provision that respects participant agency and choice

### Principle III: Cultural Safety

All NUAA programs must be culturally safe, trauma-informed, and responsive to the diverse communities we serve, particularly Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, LGBTIQ+ communities, and culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) communities.

**Commitments**:

- [CULTURAL_SAFETY_COMMITMENT_1]
- [CULTURAL_SAFETY_COMMITMENT_2]
- [CULTURAL_SAFETY_COMMITMENT_3]
- Programs are culturally appropriate and developed in consultation with community
- Staff receive ongoing training in cultural competency and trauma-informed practice
- Language accessibility (interpreters, plain language, visual materials)
- No "one size fits all" approaches - programs adapt to community needs

### Principle IV: Data Ethics

NUAA respects the rights of participants to privacy, autonomy, and control over their own data and narratives.

**Commitments**:

- [DATA_ETHICS_COMMITMENT_1]
- [DATA_ETHICS_COMMITMENT_2]
- [DATA_ETHICS_COMMITMENT_3]
- Informed consent is explicit, ongoing, and freely given
- Data is stored securely and anonymized wherever possible
- Participants control how their stories are shared
- Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander data sovereignty principles are respected
- Data is used to benefit community, never to harm or stigmatize

## Programmatic Standards

### Standard 1: Evidence-Based Practice

All NUAA programs are grounded in evidence - whether from research, community consultation, or our own pilot programs and evaluations.

**Requirements**:

- [EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENT_1]
- [EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENT_2]
- [EVIDENCE_REQUIREMENT_3]
- Programs cite relevant research, data, or community feedback
- Pilot programs inform scale-up decisions
- Evaluation is built into program design from the start, not added as an afterthought
- Evidence from peer-led harm reduction is valued equally with academic research

### Standard 2: Evaluation Rigor

Every NUAA program includes robust evaluation with clear indicators at process, output, outcome, and impact levels.

**Requirements**:

- [EVALUATION_REQUIREMENT_1]
- [EVALUATION_REQUIREMENT_2]
- [EVALUATION_REQUIREMENT_3]
- Clear, measurable indicators defined before program starts
- Mixed methods approach (quantitative + qualitative + participatory)
- Evaluation findings are shared with community and contribute to harm reduction evidence base
- Consumer participation in evaluation design and interpretation
- Evaluation is culturally appropriate and trauma-informed

### Standard 3: Budget Integrity

All program budgets are realistic, justified, transparent, and sustainable.

**Requirements**:

- [BUDGET_REQUIREMENT_1]
- [BUDGET_REQUIREMENT_2]
- [BUDGET_REQUIREMENT_3]
- All costs are clearly justified and aligned with program activities
- Consumer remuneration is budgeted at minimum $300/session for advisory/consultation work
- Indirect costs (administration, infrastructure) are transparent and reasonable
- Sustainability is planned from day one - what happens when funding ends?
- Budget allocations reflect our values (adequate peer worker compensation, cultural safety resources, etc.)

3. **Proposals**: Every funding proposal must demonstrate mission alignment and show how the proposed program upholds NUAA's values.

4. **Evaluation**: All evaluation frameworks must reflect our commitment to evidence-based practice, evaluation rigor, and data ethics.

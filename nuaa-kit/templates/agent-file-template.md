### Available Commands

[COMMANDS_FOR_LANGUAGE]

### NUAA-Specific Commands

- `/nuaa.design` - Create comprehensive program designs with stakeholder journeys, logic models, and risk assessments
- `/nuaa.propose` - Transform program designs into funding proposals with budgets and evaluation frameworks
- `/nuaa.measure` - Develop impact measurement frameworks with process/output/outcome/impact indicators
- `/nuaa.refine` - Review and improve program design or proposal based on feedback
- `/nuaa.report` - Generate progress reports and impact summaries
- `/nuaa.document` - Create comprehensive program documentation

   - Develop logic model (inputs → activities → outputs → outcomes → impact)
   - Map risks and mitigation strategies
   - Embed NUAA principles throughout

2. **Proposal Phase**: Generate `proposal.md` using `/nuaa.propose`

   - Transform design into funding application
   - Calculate budgets and timelines

## What is a Logic Model?

A logic model is a visual representation of how your program works. It shows the logical connections between:

- **INPUTS**: Resources you invest
- **ACTIVITIES**: What you do with those resources
- **OUTPUTS**: What you produce
- **OUTCOMES**: Changes that result (short, medium, long-term)
- **IMPACT**: Broader community/system transformation

**Purpose**: Helps with planning, communication, and evaluation.

### Outcomes (Changes Observed)

**Important Caveat**: The outcomes below are largely anecdotal and observational, as systematic outcome measurement has not been implemented. They represent staff observations, participant feedback, and inferred changes. Future evaluation should test these hypotheses with rigorous measurement.

#### Short-Term Outcomes (Within program duration, 0-6 months)
| Outcome | Evidence Type | Source | Strength of Evidence |
|---------|---------------|--------|----------------------|
| Increased knowledge of [topic] | Anecdotal | Staff observations | Weak (no pre/post measurement) |
| Improved confidence in [skill] | Participant quotes | Exit conversations | Weak (self-reported, not validated) |
| Increased access to [service] | Referral tracking | Referral logs | Moderate (documented) |
| Reduced isolation, increased peer support | Stories | Participant feedback, staff notes | Weak (not measured) |

**Example Quotes/Stories** (with consent):
> "[Quote from participant illustrating outcome]" – Participant, [Program], [Year]

> "[Quote from peer worker or staff member about observed change]" – [Role], [Year]

#### Medium-Term Outcomes (6-12 months post-program)
| Outcome | Evidence | Source | Strength |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| Sustained behavior change (e.g., harm reduction practices) | Anecdotal | Follow-up conversations | Weak (no systematic follow-up) |
| Peer leadership (graduates become peer workers) | Documented | HR records | Moderate (factual) |
| [Other outcome] | [Evidence] | [Source] | [Strength] |

**Note**: Medium-term outcomes difficult to attribute without control group and systematic follow-up.

#### Long-Term Outcomes (12+ months)
| Outcome | Evidence | Source | Strength |
|---------|----------|--------|----------|
| [Outcome description] | [If any evidence exists] | [Source] | [Likely weak/anecdotal] |

**Note**: Long-term outcomes rarely measured in undocumented programs.

---

### Impact (Broader, Systemic Change)

**Context**: Impact at population or system level is difficult to attribute to a single program without rigorous evaluation design. The following are observed trends or changes that the program may have contributed to, among other factors.

| Impact Indicator | Observed Trend | Program's Likely Contribution | Evidence |
|------------------|----------------|-------------------------------|----------|
| [Community health indicator, e.g., overdose rates] | [Trend if known] | [Possible/likely/unclear] | [Public health data, media] |
| [Service system change, e.g., increased NSP access] | [Change if known] | [Contribution level] | [System data, policy changes] |
| [Stigma reduction] | [Perceptions if known] | [Contribution level] | [Surveys, community feedback] |
| [Sector capacity (peer workforce)] | [Growth if known] | [Contribution level] | [NUAA reports, sector data] |

**Hypotheses for Future Evaluation**:
- *If* this program continues to [activity]...
- *Then* we might expect [impact] within [timeframe]...
- *Which could be measured by* [indicator and data source]

### Operational Gaps

| Area | Gap Description | Current Impact | Potential Consequences if Unaddressed | Recommendation | Priority |
|------|-----------------|----------------|---------------------------------------|----------------|----------|
| **Evaluation & Data** | No systematic outcome data collection | Cannot demonstrate effectiveness, missed learning opportunities | Funding loss, inability to improve, reputational risk | Implement basic impact framework with 8-10 indicators | High |

| **Cultural Safety** | Generic approach, no Aboriginal-specific protocols | Underrepresentation of Aboriginal participants, missed cultural strengths | Harm to participants, failure to reach priority population, ethical concerns | Co-develop Aboriginal cultural safety protocol with Elders/community | High |
| **Participant Journey Mapping** | No formal intake, progression tracking, or exit process | Lost follow-up data, retention challenges, unclear participant experience | Cannot measure engagement or retention, missed refinement opportunities | Implement participant journey map with touchpoints | Medium |
| **Supervision & Support** | Informal peer worker support, no clinical supervision | Burnout risk, vicarious trauma, inconsistent quality | Peer worker wellbeing compromised, program quality drift, duty of care breach | Establish monthly clinical supervision for peer workers | High |
| **Partnership Documentation** | Verbal agreements only with [Partner names] | Unclear roles, unmet expectations, relationship fragility | Partnership breakdown, service gaps, reputational damage | Formalize partnerships with MOUs | Medium |
| **Data Management** | Paper-based or inconsistent digital records | Time-consuming, error-prone, limited analysis capacity | Data loss, reporting challenges, inefficiency | Implement secure database or CRM system | Medium |

---

### Alignment Gaps (NUAA Principles)

**Framework**: How well does the program currently embody NUAA's core principles?

| NUAA Principle | Current Alignment | Evidence | Gap Description | Recommendation | Priority |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|-----------------|----------------|----------|
| **Peer-Led Approach** | ⚠️ **Moderate** (50%) | Peers deliver sessions but not involved in design decisions | Peers are program "staff" but not co-designers or decision-makers; no peer governance structure | Establish peer advisory group with decision-making authority; involve peers in program refinement | High |
| **Harm Reduction Philosophy** | ✅ **Strong** (90%) | Non-judgmental service delivery, pragmatic approach, meets people where they're at | Program consistently applies harm reduction principles in practice | Maintain current approach; document explicitly in program design | N/A (maintain) |
| **Fair Consumer Remuneration** | ⚠️ **Moderate** (60%) | Payments made, but inconsistent rates ($[range]) and occasional delays | Rate variation creates inequity; payment delays undermine fair labor principle | Standardize remuneration at $300/session; systematize payment process (within 7 days) | High |
| **Cultural Safety** | ⚠️ **Weak** (40%) | Generic accessibility efforts but no specific protocols for Aboriginal/LGBTIQ+/CALD communities | Underrepresentation of priority groups; risk of cultural harm or inadvertent exclusion | Co-develop cultural safety protocols with Aboriginal advisors; LGBTIQ+ inclusivity audit; CALD engagement strategy | High |
| **Transparency & Accountability** | ⚠️ **Weak** (30%) | Informal decision-making, limited documentation, no public reporting | Stakeholders unclear on how program operates or evolves; trust concerns | Document decision-making processes; publish annual summary reports; establish community advisory | Medium |
| **Evidence-Based Practice** | ⚠️ **Moderate** (50%) | Program activities aligned with research, but no local evaluation | Cannot demonstrate local effectiveness; missed opportunities for evidence contribution | Implement evaluation plan; publish findings; contribute to sector knowledge base | Medium |
| **Ethical Practice (Do No Harm)** | ✅ **Strong** (85%) | Informed consent, confidentiality, participant agency respected | Minor gaps in formal ethics protocols (e.g., data storage, incident management) | Formalize ethics protocol; establish incident reporting and response procedures | Low |

**Alignment Scale**: Weak (0-50%) | Moderate (51-75%) | Strong (76-100%)

|-------|-----------|----------------|-------|--------|
| **Phase 1: Documentation** | [Month 1-3] | • Finalize program-design.md<br>• Complete logic-model.md<br>• Publish impact-framework.md<br>• Standardize peer remuneration | [Name] | In Progress |
| **Phase 2: Evaluation Setup** | [Month 3-6] | • Implement basic data collection<br>• Train staff on data entry<br>• Establish baseline measures<br>• First quarterly review | [Name] | Not Started |
| **Phase 3: Cultural Safety** | [Month 4-9] | • Engage Aboriginal advisor<br>• Develop cultural safety protocol<br>• Pilot and refine protocol<br>• Train staff and peers | [Name] | Not Started |
| **Phase 4: Governance Strengthening** | [Month 6-12] | • Establish peer advisory group<br>• Formalize partnerships<br>• Quality assurance process<br>• Transparency measures | [Name] | Not Started |
| **Phase 5: Continuous Improvement** | [Month 12+] | • Annual program review<br>• Evaluation reporting<br>• Model refinement<br>• Sector knowledge sharing | [Name] | Planned |

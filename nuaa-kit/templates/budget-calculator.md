# Budget Calculator Template

## Overview

This template helps you build comprehensive, transparent program budgets aligned with NUAA principles of fair remuneration, cultural safety, and harm reduction. Use it during program design (`/nuaa.design`) or proposal development (`/nuaa.propose`).

**Key Features**:
- Pre-populated NUAA remuneration standards ($300/session baseline)
- Standard cost categories for peer-led harm reduction programs
- Automatic calculations and percentage breakdowns
- Sensitivity scenarios (reduced/expanded funding)
- Export-ready formatting for Excel and Word proposals

## Usage Instructions

### 1. Fill in Program Details

Copy this template and fill in the Program Information section below with your specific program details.

### 2. Complete Budget Tables

Work through each category table, adjusting quantities and rates based on your program design. All subtotals calculate automatically when exported to Excel.

### 3. Review Assumptions

Document all rate assumptions in the "Budget Assumptions" section. Funders appreciate transparency about how you calculated costs.

### 4. Run Sensitivity Scenarios

Complete at least one sensitivity analysis (e.g., "What if funding is reduced by 20%?") to show program flexibility and risk management.

### 5. Export

- **For Word proposals**: Copy tables directly
- **For Excel**: Use the provided formulas
- **For internal planning**: Keep as Markdown in program design folder

## Quality Checklist

Before finalizing your budget, check:

- [ ] All line items aligned with program design logic model
- [ ] Peer remuneration rate meets or exceeds $300/session standard
- [ ] Total budget realistic for proposed scope and timeline
- [ ] Assumptions documented and justified
- [ ] Overhead/admin percentage appropriate for organizational context (typically 10-20%)
- [ ] Sensitivity analysis addresses funder's likely questions
- [ ] All calculations verified (recommend double-check in Excel)
- [ ] Budget summary percentages add to 100%
- [ ] Costs compared to similar programs (reasonable range?)
- [ ] Culturally safe elements budgeted (e.g., interpreters, accessible venues)
- [ ] Evaluation budget sufficient for proposed impact framework
- [ ] Version number and date updated

---

## Integration with Other NUAA-Kit Artifacts

- **program-design.md**: Budget must align with program activities in logic model
- **proposal.md**: Budget summary table embeds into Section 5 (Budget)
- **impact-framework.md**: Evaluation costs must support indicator data collection
- **logic-model.md**: Inputs section lists financial resources (this budget)

## Tips for Funder Confidence

1. **Transparency**: Show your work. Funders trust budgets that explain assumptions clearly.
2. **Alignment**: Every budget line should trace back to the program design.
3. **Realism**: Avoid both overestimation (looks like padding) and underestimation (raises viability concerns).
4. **Peer Equity**: Never compromise peer remuneration to fit a budget. Adjust scope instead.
5. **Flexibility**: Sensitivity analysis demonstrates you've thought through risks.
6. **Evidence**: Reference similar programs, market rates, quotes from vendors.

---

**NUAA Principle Reminder**: Fair remuneration for peer expertise is non-negotiable. If budget constraints threaten peer payment standards, reduce program scope or decline the funding opportunity.

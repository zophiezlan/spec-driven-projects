# NUAA Accessibility & Inclusive Content Guidelines

Status: DRAFT

These guidelines ensure NUAA program, evaluation, and proposal documents are accessible, inclusive, and culturally safe.

## Principles

- People-first and rights-affirming language
- Trauma-informed structure and tone
- Plain language (target reading age: 8–10 for participant-facing materials; < Year 10 for funder/community summaries)
- Consistent semantic heading hierarchy
- Inclusive examples (avoid stereotypes, stigmatizing narratives)
- Visual and linguistic accessibility across devices

## Content Checklist

| Area               | Requirement                                                                    | Quick Check                           |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- |
| Language           | Avoid jargon; explain acronyms on first use                                    | Are all acronyms expanded once?       |
| Stigma             | Use non-judgmental phrasing ("people who use drugs" not "addicts")             | Any stigmatizing labels present?      |
| Plainness          | Short sentences (<20 words), active voice                                      | Excessively long sentences flagged?   |
| Tone               | Empowering, not sensationalist                                                 | Any fear-based framing?               |
| Cultural Safety    | Acknowledge Aboriginal & Torres Strait Islander data sovereignty when relevant | Section present where data collected? |
| Gender & Sexuality | Use inclusive language (e.g., "people of all genders")                         | Any binary assumptions?               |
| Disability         | Avoid ableist metaphors ("crazy", "lame")                                      | Any flagged words?                    |
| Consent & Autonomy | Emphasize choice and withdrawal rights                                         | Informed consent section included?    |

## Visual Formatting

- Use `#`, `##`, `###` only (avoid skipping levels)
- Keep paragraphs short (2–5 sentences)
- Provide alt text for all images (describe function, not aesthetics only)
- Ensure tables have headers and concise labels
- Avoid color-only meaning (e.g., red vs green without labels)
- Maintain sufficient contrast (WCAG AA: ratio ≥ 4.5:1 for text)

## Document Structure

1. Title & Status (DRAFT / FINAL)
2. Purpose / Audience
3. Core Sections (logical flow, headings no deeper than H3)
4. Appendices (optional)
5. Revision History / Changelog (for FINAL)

## Inclusive Language Patterns

| Instead of             | Use                                     | Why                            |
| ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| "Addicts"              | "People who use drugs"                  | Person-first, non-stigmatizing |
| "Clean" (re: sobriety) | "Not currently using" / specify context | Avoid moral judgement          |
| "Victim" (of overdose) | "Person who experienced an overdose"    | Neutral, respectful            |
| "Transgenders"         | "Trans and gender diverse people"       | Accurate, inclusive            |
| "Crazy" / "Insane"     | "Distressing" / name actual issue       | Avoid ableism                  |

## Alt Text Guidance

- Convey purpose or information ("Peer worker facilitating training on naloxone administration")
- Omit "image of" unless needed for clarity
- Keep concise (≤150 characters where possible)
- For complex charts: provide data summary below the image

## Table Accessibility

- Always include a header row
- Avoid merged cells for core data
- Provide explanatory caption or preceding paragraph
- Keep cell content scannable (avoid long paragraphs inside cells)

## Readability Targets

| Audience                 | Target Flesch Reading Ease | Approx Grade |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------- | ------------ |
| Participants / Community | 60–80                      | Year 8–10    |
| Funder Summary           | 50–65                      | Year 10–11   |
| Technical Appendix       | 30–55                      | Year 12+     |

(Use readability checker in future automation task.)

## PDF / Export Considerations (Future)

- Tag headings for screen readers
- Preserve reading order (avoid complex multi-column layouts)
- Embed alt text metadata
- Use real text (avoid text baked into images)

## Quality Assurance Workflow

1. Draft document using plain language and inclusive patterns
2. Run placeholder + markdown linter (scripts provided)
3. Manual pass for stigma, empowerment, autonomy references
4. Peer review (consumer advisory) for cultural resonance
5. Final accessibility check (contrast, alt text, headings)
6. Mark Status: FINAL and add entry in kit changelog

## Future Enhancements

- Automated readability scoring script
- Stigma language scanner (regex pattern list)
- Alt text completeness checker
- Visual contrast audit tool

Adopt these guidelines across all NUAA kit templates to increase clarity, safety, and inclusiveness for diverse audiences.

# NUAA Project

_AI-Assisted Project Management for NSW Users and AIDS Association_

**A specialized adaptation of Spec-Driven methodology for program design, proposal writing, implementation planning, and impact measurement at NUAA.**

## What is Spec-Driven Project Management?

Spec-Driven Project Management focuses on structured, executable program documentation for NGOs. Instead of jumping straight into delivery, we capture intent and constraints in living documents (specs, plans, tasks, measures) and use AI to assist with consistent, repeatable outputs — from program designs to funding proposals and impact reports.

## Getting Started

- [Installation Guide](installation.md)
- [Quick Start Guide](quickstart.md)
- [Local Development](local-development.md)

## Core Philosophy

The NUAA kit emphasizes:

- **Intent-first planning** where program specifications define the "what" before implementation
- **Guardrails** via an explicit constitution and templates to maintain quality and consistency
- **Iterative refinement** across program design, proposal drafting, and measurement planning
- **AI assistance** for synthesis, validation, and transformation of program documents

## Development Phases

## Experimental Goals

Our research and experimentation focus on:

### Technology Independence

- Create applications using diverse technology stacks
- Validate the hypothesis that Spec-Driven Development is a process not tied to specific technologies, programming languages, or frameworks

### Enterprise Constraints

- Demonstrate mission-critical application development
- Incorporate organizational constraints (cloud providers, tech stacks, engineering practices)
- Support enterprise design systems and compliance requirements

### User-Centric Development

- Build applications for different user cohorts and preferences
- Support various development approaches (from vibe-coding to AI-native development)

### Creative & Iterative Processes

- Validate the concept of parallel implementation exploration
- Provide robust iterative feature development workflows
- Extend processes to handle upgrades and modernization tasks
